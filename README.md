## Playing checkers with your mind: An interactive multiplayer hardware game platform for brain-computer interfaces (SSVEP)
•	steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs)
•	Few hardware-based BCI games using a physical board have been developed.
•	“Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to control external devices based solely on changes in brain activity.” Good quote to explain BCI.
•	BCI provide paralyzed or locked-in individuals a means to communicate.
•	The majority of BCIs rely on the measurement and classification of event-related potentials— electrical activity generated given specific events in the environment around the user—using electroencephalography (EEG)
•	SSVEP Advantages: require little to no pre-run classifier training, higher information transfer rates (than P300 or motor imagery)
•	the users were able to achieve relatively high accuracy for an SSVEP-based BCI (72.3% for subject with little/no SSVEP experience)
•	Increases No. of competing stimuli decreases peak SSVEP power for the target stimulus in that region.
•	our hardware-based approach is not limited to gaming. By adding LEDs, SSVEP-based interaction could be enabled in a multitude of existing hardware systems.

## Design a brain computer interface gaming system using steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)
•	The brain computer interface (BCI) is an emerging technology for paralyzed people to communicate with external environments through their minds
•	current EEG equipment utilizes metal electrodes, such as gold cup, AgCl, etc., with electrolytes to attach on human skin. These wet-type electrodes are not convenient for use. requires a lousy preparation process and the refill of electrolyte after using one or two hours. In this study, the dry-electrode IMEC headset V1 system was adopted to implement a brain computer interface.
•	Compared to other BCI systems which adopt wet-type EEG electrodes, the IMEC dry electrode system is more comfortable and more convenient for users, since no EEG preparation is needed.
•	Higher concentration level will result in better accuracy.
•	The proposed BCI system can also be used for paralyzed patients to control home facilities for self-caring purpose in the future.
•	Scientist, physicians and engineers are working together in order to develop assistive technologies for helping paralyzed people.
•	The system has the features of lightness and comfortableness, which is suitable for long-time wearing
•	The averaged accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR) over the three subjects were 96% and 18.23 bits/min, respectively.

## A spacecraft game controlled with a brain-computer interface using SSVEP with phase tagging (SSVEP)
•	This paper presents a brain-computer interface game that controls a spacecraft that has to avoid obstacles in a space route.
•	The neural mechanism is based on steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) combined with phase tagging
•	Phase extraction is applied to narrowband frequency of SSVEP. The stimuli frequencies were selected in a 3-5 Hz range that provides a high level of comfort. causing low eye-strain, which is an advantage compared to other SSVEP approaches
•	A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that creates a new communication channel based on brain-wave decoding
•	There are several brain-wave recording techniques, but the electroencephalography (EEG) is the one that enables the most comfortable use of BCI by able-bodied and motor disabled individuals
•	Currently, wet electrodes still require a 10-15 minutes for subject preparation, which includes scalp cleaning, placement of electrodes and impedance checking.
•	The new type of control provided by BCI interfaces already attracted the interest of the entertainment industry.
•	Using BCI games in everyday life can bring huge benefits since it can be used as a neurorehabilitation tool for recovery from incidents of stroke and traumatic brain injuries, treat seizure disorders or help children and adolescents with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
•	Moreover, BCI games can also be used by the general population for pure entertainment or to increase their attention skills.
•	Games are the obvious choice when the objective is to capture people's attention

## Gaming controlling via brain-computer interface using multiple physiological signals
•	Developing a portable EEG-based device of a smaller size with easy wearing is an important goal. 
•	There are already many BCI systems that utilize eye movement. These BCI systems are very useful for users with severe disabilities
•	Also, wireless transmission is more convenient for transmitting EEG and EOG data than other methods of data transmission. Therefore, our system incorporates wireless technology to enable the use of this technology in daily life.
•	Compared with other eye movement detection methods, no more electrodes are needed in our system to extract EEG signals
•	Also, the users can easily play the BCI game and have fun with high accuracy.

## A brain-computer interface for shared vehicle control on TORCS car racing game
•	Brain-computer interface (BCI), an actively progressing field in brain engineering, refers to a platform that measures the specific intent of the user and issues commands to the computer by using EEG.
•	we develop a BCI environment that controls an online 3D car racing game simulator, as known as TORCS, using EEG. Using sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) as command paradigm, we extract EEG signals corresponding to the user’s right hand, left hand, and both hands.
•	shared vehicle control system based on EEG to provide faster intention cognition than that of the electromyography (EMG) signals response.
In the racing game or First-person shooter (FPS) games, fast intention cognition is important.
•	Originally, BCI research was a field of study focused on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and patients suffering from motor neuron disease. However, in recent years, BCI’s field of application has expanded to include not only people with disabilities, but also gaming—increasing studies aimed to provide concentration improvement training services, among others, to the general public.
•	Good picture showing how BCI works

## Development of a mind-controlled Android racing game using a brain computer interface (BCI)
•	Recently, with the development of BCI, several research institutions and organizations have developed some games that are interacted with BCI to enrich user's experience. However, most of these games are only used in computers and just focus on the realization of direction strategies
•	Recently, with a hot research focus on BCI, the attempt of using BCI to interact with games’ playing has become more and more popular
•	Many BCI-controlled games however: 1) they are computerused; 2) just focus on movement direction control strategies like distinctions of left, right, up, and down in BCI, and hardly interact with user’s mental state data like user’s stressful feeling.
•	The BCIs can be classified as two types: a direct/invasive one and the indirect/noninvasive one [7]. The invasive one needs implanting sensors to touch brain cortex so that it is rarely used. While the noninvasive one’s sensors are wearing on head and just touching the skin. BCIs in noninvasive ways are widely used though the strength of bioelectricity signal they got is weaker than the invasive.
•	In this game application, after the BCI detects user’s neural attention and meditation level and transports these data to Android smartphone via Bluetooth, the racing car’s speed can be controlled by user’s attention value
•	In the future, the application can add more game scenes using this BCI-controlled way, such as user can choose their intent car type by concentrating their attention, or change the game view’s color or game music by their real-time mediation value, etc
